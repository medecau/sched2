        A cron rule is a string with five space-separated fields that represent
        the minute, hour, day, month, and day of the week. Each field can contain
        a single value, a range of values, or a list of values separated by commas.

        The implementation resembles the cron syntax used in OpenBSD's `cron` and
        other Unix-like operating systems.

        The fields support the following operators:

        - `*` (asterisk) - matches all values
        - `-` (hyphen) - matches a range of values
        - `~` (tilde) - matches a random value
        - `/` (slash) - modifies ranges to include only every nth value

        Examples of valid cron rules include:

        - `0 0 * * *` - midnight of every day
        - `*/5 * * * *` - every 5 minutes
        - `0 0 * * 5` - midnight of every Friday
        - `0 0 1 */3 *` - midnight of the first day of every quarter
        - `0 9 * * 1-5` - 9:00 of every weekday
        - `0~10 9 * * 1-5` - a random minute just past 9:00 of every weekday
        - `~/30 * * * *` - twice an hour at random minutes

        Random values are chosen when the event is scheduled, and do not change
        for the lifetime of the event.

        The `priority` argument specifies the priority of the event in the
